# Gensini
Gensini score prediction using Neural networks

Introduction:<br />
Role of Metabolic Obesity and body mass index in patients of various age group with coronary artery diseases.<br />
Metabolic obesity (Insulin resistance syndrome).<br />
Indian subcontinent is highly predisposed to this condition.<br />
Prevalence of  Insulin resistance syndrome among Indians (≥30%).<br />
Among females is higher than males (50%).<br />


Problem definition:<br />
Train a model capable of predicting the GENSINI score which determines the severity of CAD in the following groups-<br />
Metabolically Healthy Normal Weight (MHNW)<br />
Metabolically Obese Normal Weight (MONW)<br />
Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO)<br />
Metabolically Abnormal Obese (MAO)<br />

Gensini Scoring:<br />
It is a scoring system for determining the severity of coronary heart disease.<br />
It provides an accurate stratification of patients according to the functional significance of their disease.<br />
It provides an opportunity to match  patients with similar degrees of coronary artery disease who are receiving different forms of treatment.<br />


Objective:<br />
To find the group showing a good association to severity of Coronary artery disease that is which category is more prone to CAD, metabolically obese or phenotypically obese.<br />
To find the prognostic markers for CAD among factors like HBA1C, FI, HOMA IR , TC, TG, HDL, LDL and hsCRP and which group shows more association.<br />
Several models were used for predicting the GENSINI scores from the given features and using regression and neural networks.<br />
Ridge Regression<br />
LASSO Regression<br />
Neural Networks<br />


Scope/Importance o Project:<br />
There are no study done in India in relation to importance of metabolic obesity and BMI status with severity of Coronary artery disease.<br />
Helpful to find how the Insulin resistance, hsCRP and Lp(a) is associated with the severity of Coronary artery disease.<br />
Effect of Lifestyle modification on Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference in post angioplasty patients.<br />
