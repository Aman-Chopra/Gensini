Gensini score prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

#### Introduction:<br />
* Role of Metabolic Obesity and Body Mass Index in patients of various age group with coronary artery diseases.<br />
* Metabolic Obesity (Insulin resistance syndrome).<br />
* Indian subcontinent is highly predisposed to this condition.<br />
* Prevalence of Insulin resistance syndrome among Indians (â‰¥30%).<br />
* Among females is higher than males (50%).<br />

#### Problem definition:<br />
Train a model capable of predicting the GENSINI score which determines the severity of CAD in the following groups:<br />
* Metabolically Healthy Normal Weight (MHNW)<br />
* Metabolically Obese Normal Weight (MONW)<br />
* Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO)<br />
* Metabolically Abnormal Obese (MAO)<br />

#### Gensini Scoring:<br />
* It is a scoring system for determining the severity of coronary heart disease.<br />
* It provides an accurate stratification of patients according to the functional significance of their disease.<br />
* It provides an opportunity to match patients with similar degrees of coronary artery disease who are receiving different forms of treatment.<br />

#### Objective:<br />
* To find the group showing a good association to severity of Coronary artery disease that is which category is more prone to CAD, metabolically obese or phenotypically obese.<br />
* To find the prognostic markers for CAD among factors like HBA1C, FI, HOMA IR, TC, TG, HDL, LDL and hsCRP and which group shows more association.<br />
* Several algorithms were compared for predicting the GENSINI scores from the given features. Algorithms used are:<br />
  * Ridge Regression<br />
  * LASSO Regression<br />
  * Neural Networks<br />

#### Scope/Importance of Project:<br />
* There are no study done in India in relation to importance of Metabolic Obesity and BMI status with severity of Coronary artery disease.<br />
* Helpful to find how the Insulin resistance, hsCRP and Lp(a) is associated with the severity of Coronary artery disease.<br />
* Effect of Lifestyle modification on Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference in post angioplasty patients.<br />
